# The Problem

After speaking with a series of stay at home parents who now consider themselves empty nesters, I began to see a pattern emerge: getting back into the workforce is hard. As a young, moldable millennial, about to get a college degree, I wake up every morning privileged by my youth; I never think twice about whether or not the workforce will find me worthy of its attention.
<br>

Hackathons are centered around the idea of “coding for social good”. When I signed up for HackDavis 2020, I saw it as an opportunity to think further about the above problem. Three amazing women, Caitlyn Liu, Nicole Fell, and Ann Ryan, sat by my side, and together we discussed, renovated, and modified our ideas over 24 hours.

# The Team

Despite the overwhelming presence of experienced computer scientists and engineers, we were excited to see what our unique minds could conceive. Caitlyn’s background in English and Technology Communications enabled us to produce content that was concise and succinct. My background in Cognitive and Computer Science gave our team the fundamental understanding of web development. As both Ann and Nicole are studying Electrical and Computer Engineering, their ability to navigate the web, conduct research, gather resources, and design the pitch deck was invaluable.

# Ideation

We began by researching the problem and seeking pain points expressed by our target audience. I will refer to our target audience as “Returners”, which can be defined as anyone who has taken an extended leave of absence from the workforce. This includes stay at home parents, veterans, and so on. We found three conclusions that affected our project design:
<br>

1. Returners are discouraged by the generational gap.
2. Returners face the challenge finding time to catch up on major technological advances.
3. There are currently only 50 Returnship Opportunities offered by companies in the United States.

# Development

With these observations in mind, Return Ready was born. We wanted to develop a website that acts as a resource hub for Returners. These resources are designed to alleviate the pain points holding back an entire market segment from returning to the workplace. We included personality quizzes, technical vocabulary definitions, and how-to guides for LinkedIn, resumes, and interviews. Additionally, we mentioned organizations that dedicate resources to increasing the inclusivity of “Returners” in the workplace.
<br>

As new-be hackers, we gained first hand experience with troubleshooting when problems arose. Due to technical problems, we resorted to using Wix, a “drag and drop” website building software, during the last few hours of the hackathon. Although our end product did not exactly match our initial vision, it acts as a first draft toward the future of [Return Ready](https://hrraizes.wixsite.com/returnready).
<br>

At the end of the 24 hours, we presented our product to various judges. To our surprise, we won second place in the Interdisciplinary Hack category. The judges acknowledged the diverse backgrounds of our team and the potential to positively impact a generation other than our own.

# What's Next For Return Ready

According to [Working Mother](https://www.workingmother.com/5-top-re-entry-mom-tips-for-getting-back-to-work-after-career-break), “more than 2.6 million women in the United States hold bachelor’s, masters, or PhD degrees but do not work outside the home.” Using this data, we calculated that if each of these women started making 35k per year, this would put an additional $91B into the economy. However, we now become tasked with creating opportunities for Returners to use their degrees and earn this income. From information found on the internet, it is estimated that only 50 established Returnship Programs are cuurently offered in the United States. A [Returnship](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonwingard/2019/02/13/are-returnships-the-key-to-relaunching-your-career/#4681ad183cdf) is “modeled after traditional student internships, organizations hire individuals for a few months to a year during which they pair employment with mentoring and training.” The lack of opportunity for those seeking to return guides our vision for the future of Return Ready. We have four goals for what is to come next:
<br>
1. Continue modifying, adding resources, and building out our website.
2. Hold in person workshops for Returners to cultivate new technical skills, work on their LinkedIn and resumes, and connect with others.
3. Help consult companies build out more returnship programs.
4. Conduct further market research on “Returners” to better understand our target audience, the problems they are facing, and the untapped potential that lies within the solution to this problem.<br>
<br>
It’s easy to feel like one can’t make an impact in such a big world. However, there is a quote from The Lorax that motivates me to try anyways: Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.
