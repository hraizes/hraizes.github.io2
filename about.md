# About me  


Hi, my name is Haley. I am currently a third year undergraduate student pursuing a double major in Computer and Cognitive Science. My two majors drive my ultimate goal of improving the overall interaction between people and technology.  


When I am not at the library, you can find me training for my next marathon, learning to rock climb, writing articles for Her Campus, or practicing my French. Most of my happiness in life comes from a cup of tea and a good book.
