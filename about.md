# About me <br>
Hi, my name is Haley. I am currently a third year undergraduate student pursuing a double major in Computer and Cognitive Science. My two majors drive my ultimate goal of improving the overall interaction between people and technology. I recently joined the [Cognition in Context Lab](https://cognitionincontext.ucdavis.edu) at the Center for Mind and Brain as an undergraduate research assistant. My main topics of interest include the development of creative problem solving, resilience, and delayed gratification during childhood.

My website displays the various hats I wear. When I am not at the library, you can find me running around the city of Davis, preparing for my second marathon. When I need a break from using my "left brain", I enjoy writing articles for Her Campus, practicing my French, or re-reading my favorite book, *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves*. Most of my happiness in life comes from a cup of tea and a good book.
