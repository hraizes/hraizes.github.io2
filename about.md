<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h2>

The name of my website has two interpretations: Haley Smiles and Haley's Miles. I have collected many "hats" over the years and this website is intended to give a glimpse into each. In layman's terms, I am a fourth year undergraduate pursuing a double major in Computer and Cognitive Science at the University of California, Davis. My two majors drive my ultimate goal of improving the interaction between people and technology. 

<br>

I work as a research assistant in the [Cognition in Context Lab](https://cognitionincontext.ucdavis.edu) at the Center for Mind and Brain . My main topics of interest include the development of creative problem solving, resilience, and delayed gratification during childhood.

When I am not at the library, you can find me running around the city of Davis, preparing for my second marathon. For the past two years, I coached Cross Country and Track at Harper Middle school in Davis. Outside of running, I love the outdoors - my two newest endevors include rock climbing and mountain biking.

<br>
When I need a break from using my "left brain", I enjoy writing, practicing my French, or re-reading my favorite books, *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves* and *Steppenwolf*. I am also the Director of Speakers Outreach for TEDxUCDavis 2020. We are holding an online conference under the theme of "What's Ne(x)t?" in the Spring of 2020.
