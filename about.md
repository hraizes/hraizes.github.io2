<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a third year undergraduate student pursuing a double major in Computer and Cognitive Science at the University of California, Davis. My two majors drive my ultimate goal of improving the interaction between people and technology. I recently joined the [Cognition in Context Lab](https://cognitionincontext.ucdavis.edu) at the Center for Mind and Brain as an undergraduate research assistant. My main topics of interest include the development of creative problem solving, resilience, and delayed gratification during childhood.

My website displays the various hats I wear. When I am not at the library, you can find me running around the city of Davis, preparing for my second marathon. When I need a break from using my "left brain", I enjoy writing articles for Her Campus, practicing my French, or re-reading my favorite book, *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves*. I am also the Director of Speakers Outreach for TEDxUCDavis 2020. We are holding a conference under the theme of "What's Ne(x)t?" in the Fall of 2020. Check out our [website](http://www.tedxucdavis.org) if you are interested in speaking, nominating a speaker, or attending our conference.
