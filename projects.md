# Return Ready
Return Ready came to life at HackDavis2020. With the help of three talented women, we compiled resources for "returners". A "returner" refers to one who has taken an extended leave of absence from the workforce. On our website, returners can find personality quizzes, technical vocabulary definitions, and how-to guides for LinkedIn, resumes, and interviews. Additionally, we highlight organizations that dedicate resources to increasing the inclusivity of “Returners” in the workplace.

# Team Progress Tracker
I have worked as a Cross Country and Track coach at Harper Middle School in Davis for the past two years. My ability to maintain a healthy sleep schedule, particpate in extracurriculars, and keep up with my school work became challenging during my first season of coaching. I found that I was often emailing parents, sending out race logistics, and planning workouts in the middle of my math homework. As a means to free myself from some of the logistical burdens of being a coach, I created an app designed to be the central hub for the team.<br>
<br>
Inside the app, parents can find a link to a google form to nodify me of athlete absenses. They can find practice times, race locations, and workout plans for the week. Additionally, each athlete has their own portfolio to track their improvement throughout the season and create personal goals.
